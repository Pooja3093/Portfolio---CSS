# Week 2 challenge: Advanced CSS

## Employee Portfolio

In this challenge I have applied the Advanced CSS coding taught to me in class, which includes:

* Flexbox layout
* Responsive design
* Box-styling
* Forms
* Selectors
* Variables

## Brief
For this challenge, a webpage was created that will be an employee portfolio.
This portfolio has four sections (clickable links are provided in the navigation bar): Home, About, Work and Contact.

When user clicks on the Home link, the webpage will display the start of the page regardless of the current location.

When the user clicks on the About link, it will take them to about section, which has short description about employee and his picture.

When the user clicks on the Work link, it will take them to Work section which has titled images to their past work. The images are linked and will take to the deployed application when clicked.

When the user clicks on the Contact link, it will take them to a form with name, email and message fields to be submitted.

All the links on this page, have some special effects like animation and color change when hovered.
This webpage is also reponsive to screen size and hence can be view on any device without compromising the layout.

## Showcase

* Responsive Layout
